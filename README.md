# Iguazio Platform Deployment Example

## Horovod
General purpose Horovod template for use with KubeFlow Pipelines.

Includes two versions:
- `HorovodPipeline.ipynb` : With `YAML` config file (for easy parameter changes)
- `HorovodPipelineNoConfig.ipynb` : With hard-coded values (for easier readibility).

### Quick-Start
1. Clone git repo into Iguazio managed Jupyter service.
2. Enter `horovod` directory.
3. Update paths/resources/scripts/etc in `config.yaml`. Place any scripts or pipeline components in `project` directory.
4. Run `HorovodPipeline.ipynb` notebook to launch Horovod Pipeline in K8s cluster.

### File Descriptions
- `HorovodPipeline.ipynb` : File that handles project setup, pipeline definition, deployment, and model endpoint testing.
- `config.yaml` : Configuration for project, training, serving, resources, etc.
- `horovod/training.py` : Horovod TensorFlow 2 training script.
- `horovod/utils.py` : Utility functions for downloading and exctracting data.
- `horovod/workflow.py` : Automatically generated python script with Kubeflow Pipeline definition. No intervention needed.
- `horovod/project.yaml` : Automatically generated YAML for MPIJob to submit on Kubernetes. No intervention needed.

### Notes for Customizing Pipeline
- Seperate different components into their own files for simplicity
    - Place component files in `project` directory or update path accordingly
